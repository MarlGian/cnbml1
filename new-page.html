      <h2>"Sonnet 116" by William Shakespeare</h2>
      <p>Let me not to the marriage of true minds<br>
      Admit impediments. Love is not love<br>
      Which alters when it alteration finds,<br>
      Or bends with the remover to remove.<br>
      O no! it is an ever-fixed mark<br>
      That looks on tempests and is never shaken;<br>
      It is the star to every wand'ring bark,<br>
      Whose worth's unknown, although his height be taken.<br>
      Love's not Time's fool, though rosy lips and cheeks<br>
      Within his bending sickle's compass come;<br>
      Love alters not with his brief hours and weeks,<br>
      But bears it out even to the edge of doom.<br>
      If this be error and upon me prov'd,<br>
      I never writ, nor no man ever lov'd.</p>

      <h2>"I Carry Your Heart With Me" by E. E. Cummings</h2>
      <p>i carry your heart with me(i carry it in<br>
      my heart)i am never without it(anywhere<br>
      i go you go,my dear;and whatever is done<br>
      by only me is your doing,my darling)<br>
      i fear<br>
      no fate(for you are my fate,my sweet)i want<br>
      no world(for beautiful you are my world,my true)<br>
      and it's you are whatever a moon has always meant<br>
      and whatever a sun will always sing is you<br>
      here is the deepest secret nobody knows<br>
      (here is the root of the root and the bud of the bud<br>
      and the sky of the sky of a tree called life;which grows<br>
      higher than soul can hope or mind can hide)<br>
      and this is the wonder that's keeping the stars apart<br>
      i carry your heart(i carry it in my heart)</p>
